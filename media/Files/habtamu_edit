# Instruction 1: Everything is case sensitive
# Instruction 2: After creating the object (e.g., Q1), DO NOT PRINT!
# Instruction 3: Be sure to define functions in reference to previously created strings/lists

# Step 1: Create a string called Q1 with the characters "Data Science for all!"
Q1 = "Data Science for all!"

# Step 2: Create a function called Q2 that loops through and prints each character in Q1.
def Q2():
    for char in Q1:
        print(char)

# Step 3: Create a function called Q3 that loops through each character in Q1 and prints "A" for each character.
def Q3():
    for _ in Q1:
        print("A")

# Step 4: Create a list called Q4 with the following five items.
Q4 = ["DTSC 520", "DTSC 550", "DTSC 575", "DTSC 600", "DTSC 650"]

# Step 5: Create a function called Q5 that loops through and prints each item in Q4.
def Q5():
    for item in Q4:
        print(item)

# Step 6: Create a function called Q6 that prints all values less than 50, starting with 2, doubled each iteration.
def Q6():
    value = 2
    while value < 50:
        print(value)
        value *= 2

# Step 7: Create a list containing the specified numbers and assign it to Q7.
Q7 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

# Step 8: Create a function called Q8 that adds all the numbers in Q7 and returns the sum.
def Q8():
    return sum(Q7)

# Step 9: Create a function called Q9 that determines how many times a number can be squared until reaching a twenty digit number.
def Q9():
    number = 3
    count = 0
    while True:
        squared = number * number
        if len(str(squared)) >= 20:
            return count
        else:
            number = squared
            count += 1

# Following the instructions not to print after creating the objects/functions
Q2_result = Q2  # Assigning the function Q2 to a variable without executing it
Q3_result = Q3  # Assigning the function Q3 to a variable without executing it
Q5_result = Q5  # Assigning the function Q5 to a variable without executing it
Q6_result = Q6  # Assigning the function Q6 to a variable without executing it
Q8_result = Q8  # Assigning the function Q8 to a variable without executing it
Q9_result = Q9  # Assigning the function Q9 to a variable without executing it
